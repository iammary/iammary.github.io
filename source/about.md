Hi! Im Jes from Cebu Ph.

My in-depth knowledge of Web technologies, my keen eye for details and my strong creative and graphical skills enable me to work harmoniously with clients to develop wireframes, mock-ups and prototypes and then transform them into reality.

My core competencies lie in advanced CSS based design, responsive designs and profound understanding of user interface design on an array of web technologies. I am an expert with regards usability, accessibility, multiplatform and cross-browser functionality. I am logical, resourceful and independent but at the same time, I work equally well on a diverse, multi-functional global team.

I delight in working with challenging functions and in designs structured around complex integration. I have a passion for solving problems, constantly perfecting my craft, and producing work that I can be proud of.

I enjoy sharing technical knowledge to budding programmers. My greatest joy is in seeing them achieve their dreams with my guidance. I want to inspire people.
